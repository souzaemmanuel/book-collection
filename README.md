# BookCollection

- This is a simple project that you can add book, and see the list of your books.
- I used it to learn how to use the new template sintax of angular version 17 and other features like @switch, @for, etc.
- This project uses Angular versions 17th and a json server.

## Running the app

- Go to db folder and run `json-server --watch .\db.json`. Now, this endpoint was created `http://localhost:3000/books/`.
- Run `npm run start` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit test via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
